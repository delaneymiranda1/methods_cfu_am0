# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I got stuck on the writing a method for 3 strings part and instead of going to find the answer I worked through it a few times and figured out what I was doing wrong on my own! It was a HECK YEAH moment.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods are time savers. They send instructions to your console.
